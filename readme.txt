Things I NEED to do yet : 


0 --> Take another look at login + signup pages and session codes
1 --> Add burger menu option for upbar.php on small screen. 
2 --> Make footer responsive for small screen.
3 --> change welcomepage.php to index.php so that localhost/web3x would open it directly
4 --> make everything a directory no file names in url needed just use index.php
